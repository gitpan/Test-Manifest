=head1 NAME

Test::Manifest - interact with a t/test_manifest file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See the functions section.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MakeMaker assumes that you want to run all of the .t files
in the t/ directory in ascii-betical order during C<make test>
unless you say otherwise.  This leads to some interesting 
naming schemes for test files to get them in the desired order.

You can specify any order or any files that you like, though,
with the C<test> directive to WriteMakefile.

Test::Manifest looks in the t/test_manifest file to find out
which tests you want to run and the order in which you want
to run them.  It constructs the right value for MakeMaker to
do the right thing.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item run_t_manifest

Run all of the files in t/test_manifest through Test::Harness:runtests
in the order they appear in the file.

If you want to use this, in Makefile.PL you need to override some 
MakeMaker magic (after you load ExtUtils::MakeMaker).  I recommend
putting something like this directly in Makefile.PL so it does not
depend on anything else.  A Makefile.PL with dependencies is a big
headache.

	sub ExtUtils::MM_Any::test_via_harness
		{
		my($self, $perl, $tests) = @_;
	
		return qq|\t$perl "-MTest::Manifest" | .
			   qq|"-e" "run_t_manifest(\$(TEST_VERBOSE), '\$(INST_LIB)', | .
			   qq|'\$(INST_ARCHLIB)')"\n|;
		}

=cut

sub run_t_manifest 
	{
    require Test::Harness;
    require File::Spec;

    $Test::Harness::verbose = shift;

    local @INC = @INC;
    unshift @INC, map { File::Spec->rel2abs($_) } @_;

	my @files = get_t_files();
	print STDERR "Test::Manifest::test_harness found [@files]\n";
	
    Test::Harness::runtests( @files );
	}

=item get_t_files()

In scalar context it returns a single string that you can use directly
in WriteMakefile().

In list context it returns a list of the files it found in
t/test_manifest.

If a t/test_manifest file does not exist, get_t_files() returns
nothing.

get_t_files() warns you if it can't find t/test_manifest, or if
entries start with "t/".

sub get_t_files()
	{
	carp( "$Manifest does not exist!" ) unless -e $Manifest;
	return unless open my $fh, $Manifest;
	
	my @tests = ();
	
	while( <$fh> )
		{
		chomp;
		carp( "test file begins with t/ [$_]" ) if m|^t/|;
		push @tests, "t/$_" if -e "t/$_";
		}
		
	return wantarray ? @tests : join " ", @tests;
	}

=item make_test_manifest()

Creates the test_manifest file in the t directory by reading
the contents of the t directory.

TO DO: specify tests in argument lists.

TO DO: specify files to skip.

=cut

sub make_test_manifest()
	{
	carp( "t/ directory does not exist!" ) unless -d "t";

		{
		$file =~ s|^t/||;
		print $fh "$file\n";
		$count++;
		}
	
	return $count;
	}

=item manifest_name

Returns the name of the test manifest file, relative to t/
