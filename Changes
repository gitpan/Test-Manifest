1.22_03 - Tue Jul 29 21:14:49 2008
	* Fixed bug for missing file: previously the missing file
	name was passed through to run_t_files, although without
	the t/ added to its path. Test::Manifest should only
	warn about and skip missing files.

1.23 - Fri Jul 17 03:04:38 2009
	* Move everything to git and finally make a release

1.22_02 - Thu Jan 24 06:13:13 2008
	* File path and unlink fixes for VMS (RT #32061). Let's see if this works.

1.22_01 - Sun Jan  6 14:18:46 2008
	* Changed test file names to only have one dot in them so they
	work on VMS and ODS-2 file systems: RT #32061
	* This is a test release.

1.22 - Sat Oct 27 21:24:10 2007
	* distro cleanups after moving from CVS to SVN

1.21 - Wed Sep 19 19:45:27 2007
	* [BUGFIX] getting rid of Test::More

1.17 - Thu Feb 22 13:20:23 2007
	* Updated to Sourceforge's SVN repository
	* Dist conforms to META 1.2 spec
	* No feature changes, so no big hurry to upgrade

1.16 - Tue Aug 29 17:43:16 2006
	* Added an experimental feature to grab file names from additional
	files. Just specify which other files to grab file names from:

	;include names_in_this_file.txt

	See the docs for get_t_files().

	* This is an experimental feature. This feature is experimental.

1.14 - Sat Mar 26 20:55:45 2005
	* put paths together with File::Spec (so this should work on
	Windows
	* You can now define levels of testing with TEST_LEVEL (e.g.
	make test TEST_LEVEL=2)

1.13 - Sat Mar 19 12:36:04 2005
	* Added POD Coverage tests
	* No more fooling with ExtUtils::* ---> put things in MY::* to
	change behavior.
	* If you are using Test::Manifest, you should upgrade and adjust
	your Makefile.PL: the magic happens when Test::Manifest loads, so
	you only need to load it.  Ensure you require the right version:
		eval "use Test::Manifest 1.13";

1.11 - Sat Sep 25 18:43:38 2004
	* This is a release version.  It's the same code as 0.95
	* Some doc updates

0.95 - Thu Sep  2 15:59:26 2004
* Test::Manifest is now more tolerant of sloppiness.  It strips leading
and trailing whitespace as it reads lines from test_manifest, and it
skips comment lines.  
* If you already have Test::Manifest, you don't need to rush to get this
new version unless you have a problem with whitespace issues.

0.93 - Fri Feb 20 15:18:23 2004
	* some minor tweaks for warnings, clarity
	* docs show way to make Test::Manifest optional (should have thought 
	of it sooner)

0.92 - Wed Jul 30 14:10:00 2003
        * Made tests run clean under warnings.
	* Closed a file that failed when trying to delete it under
	  Windows.  (Thanks Mike O'Regan)
	* Added POD tests.

0.91 - Wed Dec 11 00:48:55 2002
	* require ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.x so the right run_tests is 
	available

0.9 - Thu Oct 10 00:27:13 EDT 2002
	+ removed as many dependencies as possible
